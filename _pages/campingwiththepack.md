Thank you for selecting "Camping with the Pack". To allocate a campsite for you, we need a little bit of information.
**Please only fill this form out once** if you have any questions please contact [puproar](https://t.me/puproar) or email puproar at outlook.com.

**We only need one person per tent site to fill this form out** but please list everyone else whos in your tent when you do. We dont want to miss anyone.

When allocating sites, we do preference keeping packs together, and those who booked first. TRC campsites are designed for 4/6 person tents generally - but there are a small handful of larger tent sites. Remember that your camping price is based on the number of people in your tent, not the number of tents. If you want a tent site per person or couple feel free (just fill out a form per site wanted).  Remember, we are providing you 3 meals - with luck this will limit the number of "camp kitchens" that people feel they need to bring ;) Once site allocations are made, feel free to coordinate with other site members to share major items, and limit the amount of gear you need to carry in and out. 

We will be allocating sites across sites 1, 2 and 5 this year.  Please see the map for locations:

My preference is to send you a telegram message with your site number and to message you if we need to de-conflict; so if you have one please provide your handle (email is the fallback).
