While we are not a charity or registered non-profit (there is just to much overhead in doing so), "The Puppies of TRC" aims to operate in the spirit of such an organization. We do not make a profit, and aim to keep costs as low as possible while providing you a great event. 

As with all events, none of this would be possible with out the additional support and charity of individuals and groups in our community - particularly TRC Semi-Permanent sites who host us. Our thanks and gratitude goes to those parties that help this event be possible.

The following data may not be fully complete - as some individuals and groups do provide items out of pocket. We do also give free event passes (excluding camping) to folks who host events, or run activities, so income != number of attendees.
