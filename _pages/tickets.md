## Notes
This year, TRC is not doing reserved tent sites (its first come first served, outside of group bookings). Camping with the pack will get you a reserved tent site, alongside other attendees. 

- Camping with the pack tickets include all camping costs
- BYO Event tickets require you have another camping arrangement with TRC (RV, Seasonal Site ect)
