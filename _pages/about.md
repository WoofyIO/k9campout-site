Do you miss the days of camping with pups in years gone by? Well, we are here to make it a thing again.

K9 Campout is ran by a group of pups that just want to enjoy romping around in the forest with other like-minded pups and handers. This is a private event that will be hosted at CampTRC - and is not affiliated with any PAH organization.
