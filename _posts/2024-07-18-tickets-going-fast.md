## Ticket Sales Are Live Again
Firstly - Ticket sales are live again (for the last round), get yours at [https://k9campout.com/tickets](https://k9campout.com/tickets) or [https://www.eventbrite.com/e/k9-campout-tickets-865227818697](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/k9-campout-tickets-865227818697)

## Last Chance To Get Your Ticket Online
Hi folks, so this year we will be closing out the "camping with the pack" tickets in the next week or so. We have a record number of campers taking up this option and its going to take us a little bit to juggle all the sites. So - if you want to book camping with the pack, now is your chance! Site allocations will start imminently. If you have booked camping with the pack, please make sure someone in your tent (or group) has filled out the form at [https://k9campout.com/campingwiththepack](https://k9campout.com/campingwiththepack).

BYO Camping tickets (where you book camping with TRC directly, and just need an event pass) will stay open until Wednesday before camping.

## Pup Tags
We are starting to engrave pup tags on Monday. If you want to adjust or update your name, please do so on your eventbrite booking (open eventbrite in a browser, go to tickets, select K9 Campout, then edit). Monday the 12th will be the last chance to make a booking and get an engraved tag. After that, its best effort (and if your paying onsite, we will likely only have blanks).
